Navigating the web of Canadian government benefits can feel like a part-time job. You have the **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)** coming on the 20th, the **GST/HST credit** coming quarterly, and the new **Carbon Rebate (CAIP)** landing in your bank account on a different schedule entirely.

Most calculators online only focus on one of these at a time. You have to go to one site for your child benefits, another for your tax credits, and a third to figure out provincial help.

**That changes today.**

We have updated LoonieSense with a new **Household Benefit Estimator**. It combines 5 major federal and provincial programs into a single, privacy-friendly calculator.

## What it Calculates
Our tool uses the official **July 2024 to June 2025** benefit year rules to estimate:

1.  **Canada Child Benefit (CCB):** The tax-free monthly payment for families with children under 18.
2.  **Provincial Child Benefits:** Includes the **Ontario Child Benefit (OCB)** and the **Alberta Child and Family Benefit (ACFB)**.
3.  **GST/HST Credit:** The quarterly payment for low-to-modest income individuals and families.
4.  **Canada Carbon Rebate (CAIP):** Formerly the "Climate Action Incentive," calculated for residents of Ontario and Alberta (including the 20% rural top-up).
5.  **Canada Workers Benefit (CWB):** A refundable tax credit to help individuals and families who are working and earning a low income.

## How to Use the Estimator

To get an accurate result, you need two key numbers from your tax return. We ask for both because the government uses them for different things.

### 1. Family Net Income (Line 23600)
This is the "clawback" number. It includes **everything** you earned: wages, employment insurance (EI), pensions, and even taxable capital gains.
* **Why we need it:** As this number goes up, your benefits (like CCB and GST) go down.

### 2. Working Income
This is the "eligibility" number. It generally includes **only** money earned from a job or self-employment. It excludes passive income like investments or EI.
* **Why we need it:** You generally need to earn at least $3,000 in working income to qualify for the **Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)**.

### Step-by-Step
1.  Open the [LoonieSense Calculator](/).
2.  Switch the toggle at the top from **CPP/OAS** to **Benefits**.
3.  Enter your Province and Marital Status (these affect your GST and Carbon Rebate).
4.  Input your income details.
5.  Add your children (and check the disability box if they have the Disability Tax Credit).

## Privacy First
Just like our CPP calculator, the Household Benefit Estimator runs **100% in your browser**. We do not store, save, or transmit your financial data. You can experiment with different income scenarios safely, knowing your data never leaves your device.
