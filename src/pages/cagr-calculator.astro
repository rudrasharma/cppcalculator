    <p class="mb-4">
      The <strong>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</strong> is one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike a simple average return, CAGR smoothes out the volatility of investment returns. It represents the rate at which an investment would have grown if it had grown the same rate every single year and the profits were reinvested at the end of each year.
